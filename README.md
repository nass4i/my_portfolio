# Project 1 : Neural Decoding on 
* In collaboration with CERVO Research Center, we have decoded neural activity of rotends in a free behavior space. We have mainly used Neural Network Models such as LSTM and Transformers

# Project 2 : Comparison between *model-free* and *model-based*
* Implementation of different *model-free* and *model-based* on a simple game (Connect4) to highlight the main differences.
* Model free models : A2C, DQN, PPO
* Model based models : MuZero
